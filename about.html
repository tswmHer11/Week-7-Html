        <p> Overland Express came to life when a group of friends whose dreams were to turn there everyday vehicles into adventure mobiles. They were experienced engineers who wanted the ability to take their vehicles on weekend adventures and also use them as their daily drivers. With there experience and enginuity, they started creating products for their own vehicles. They liked it so much, they decided to make their own company because they knew other people had their same dreams but didn't know how or where to look. </p>
